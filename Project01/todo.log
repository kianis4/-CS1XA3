../Project01/README.md:12:This feature allows the user to see any place #TODO appear in his repository. To use this feature, user must enter 1 when prompted too select a feature. Executing this will create a file called todo.log. This file contains all places #TODO appear in the directory excluding the  project01_analyze.sh script. The user will then be prompted if they would like to display this file. If the user types 'y' or 'Y' it will be displayed. and then the script will be exited. The user can run another feature by exicuting the script again if they wish.
